**Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions**

Suspicious or malicious browser extensions can have serious and wide-ranging impacts on your security, privacy, and system performance

1. Data theft & Credential Theft
    - it can capture your keystrokes, grab login credentials, credit card numbers—often unnoticed—as you type on websites
2. Browser & Identity Hijacking
    - Some malware can hybridize or “morph” into legitimate extensions—disabling authentic ones, cloning icons, and tricking you into entering sensitive info 
3. Malware & ransomware Loader
    - Extensions can install other malware, such as ransomware, spyware, or trojans—even after being removed
4. Privacy invation & Profiling
    - Many extensions silently collect browsing habits, location, emails—then sell or leak that data
5. Performance & Stability Degradation
    - Poorly coded or overloaded extensions can slow down page loading, increase CPU/memory usage, crash tabs, or freeze your browser
6. Enterprise Risks: Espionage & Data Leakage
    - In organizational environments, malicious extensions can be used for keylogging, stealing internal documents, or launching network-wide breaches


**How to identify them**

  1. Review Permissions
      - Malicious extensions often request execessive access like "read and change all site data," clipboard, or keystroke permissions  
  2. Check Extensions Behaviour
      - Unexpected ads or pop-ups
      - Homepage/search engine change
      - Browser slowdowns  
  3.  Inspect Developer & Reviews
      - Only install from official stores
      - Before installing check
          - Developer name and website
          - Review quality
          - Last update date
  4.  Analyze Technical Clues
      - Advanced user can inspect the manifest file for permissions mismatched with functionality
      - Use browser developer tool or site like virustotal to check for suspisious network activity
            
  5. Audit Regularly
      - Go to your browser extension manager and check
          - Disable unsued ectensions and remove ones you don't recognize
          - Do this often
